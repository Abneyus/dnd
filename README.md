Obtain a properly formatted database:

	******
	Spell Name
	Everything Else
	******
	2nd Spell Name
	Everything Else
	Etc.

The DatabaseOrganizer build will allow easy conversion of the community resource folder's spell lists to proper database format.

	1. Combine as many of the class spell lists as you want in a text document named omegaDatabase.txt in the same folder as the DatabaseOrganizer.jar
	
	2. Run DatabaseOrganizer.jar
	
	3. Delete omegaDatabase.txt and testSpellDatabase.txt
	

You can edit spellList.txt while the program is running, just change the scale for the program to refresh and update to your changes.
